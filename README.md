Created this for a Kotlin course on Hyperskill.
So don't blame me for being rude to my customers, all the user handling is to their specifications. :D
Was a fun project with a good real life conncetion and the first time I used classes because I just felt they were a good solution to handle data between functions and not because a task demanded I do so.
